# Hash-Kit
Compilation of python files that make up a small toolkit that can be used to hash passwords, decrypt simple hashes, and verify that two hashes are the same

Two of of these files ("trans_hash.py" and "inverse_trans_hash.py" respectively) use the "hashlib" module in order to encrypt and decrypt SHA-256 hashes

Prior to installation, ensure you have python installed in your terminal and it's up to date.

To install, simply run "git clone https://github.com/RavenTheBird789/Hash-Kit" in your Linux terminals command line

To run, simply type enter "python3 htk_main.py" in your Linux terminals command line
